#summary Description of the current development stage of the filesystem driver.

= Introduction =

The Filesystem driver is the core module of the project. Its task is to supply files from the three available data stores (by speed: RAM, SSD and HDD) and apply different caching and prefetching algoritms for moving data between the data stores. 

The first stage of development, allowing for easier testing and debugging, is by using FUSE and running the filesystem routines in user space. Different caching algorithms will be implemented. *These will be the deliverables for the SOA 2009-2010 course.*

The second stage is a kernel module implementing an optimized variant of the filesystem developed in the first stage.
